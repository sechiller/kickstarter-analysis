## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Visualizations were used to summarize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    May is the most popular month for play launches, with June coming in a close second. These months also had the highest rate of success. December had the fewest number of launches and the highest rate of failure. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

     Most of the time, a smaller goal leads to a higher chance of a successful outcome. The excseption is the 9 plays that have a budget between $35,000 and $44,999 which show a much higher rate of success. This might warrant further investigation. You can also conclude that the majorities of plays had a goal of $1,000 to $4,999 with 85% of plays having goals of less than $10,000. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

     It would be interesting to bring in the pledged data to better understand the outcomes quantitatively and not just whether the play was successful.
